# OpenXR Tutorial

This repository contains the source for openxr-tutorial.

It will be updated as tutorial sections are completed, for now its purpose is just to briefly demonstrate
minimal OpenXR instance creation using a single compiler invocation.

```
clang -I .\include\ -o .\bin\2_1_create_instance.exe .\src\2_1_create_instance\main.c .\lib\openxr_loader.lib
```
